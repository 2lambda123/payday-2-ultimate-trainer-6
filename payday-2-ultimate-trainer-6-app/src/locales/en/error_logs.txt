Error log 1
Error log 2
Error log 3
...
```

Here is an example implementation in Python:

```python
# Import necessary modules
import os

# Define the file path
file_path = "payday-2-ultimate-trainer-6-app/src/locales/en/error_logs.txt"

# Open the file in write mode
with open(file_path, "w") as file:
    # Write the error logs to the file
    file.write("Error log 1\n")
    file.write("Error log 2\n")
    file.write("Error log 3\n")
    # ...

# Commit message: "feat/fix: the commit message"
